FLOPPY_START ORG $8a *This is the code we start executing as soon as a bootable floppy is detected

    tst.w ROM85              *Test to see if we are on an original mac
    bmi.s error_original_mac *And jump to failure code if so
    
    move.l ROMBase,a0        *This appears to be loading the 8th entry of the trap table into d1(?)
    move.w 8(a0),d1 
    
    *Here, it looks like we have a null-terminated string of word values at FLOPPY_BASE+$da which we are trying to match
    *one by one to the value in ROM at ROMBase+8. If we get a match to the ROMBase+8 value, we go on to potentially set up
    *the user heap base at the end of our requested system heap area and then we set up a stack frame and jump to the main
    *initialization code. If we hit the end of the string without matching anything, we just skip directly to the init code.
    *This would seem to probably be a check on the ROM version, meaning some don't need the call stack set up or some don't
    *need the heap set up &c.
    moveq #-2,d6             *Subtract two from d6 so that our first add starts us off at zero
add_two
    addq.w #2,d6             *Increment d6 by two (or one word width)
    move.w ($da,PC,d6.w),d0  *Load value $da[d6] into d0 (since we don't know where we are, PC-relative addressing) 
    beq.s sys_init           *If $da[d6] was zero, branch elsewhere
    cmp.w d0,d1              *Check to see if the value we loaded from $da[d6] equals ROM[8] 
    bne.s add_two            *If they didn't match, get the next index of $da[] and check again
    
    cmp.b #$76,d1            *See if the low byte of d1 == $76
    bhi.s skip_heap_init     *if they are, skip setting up the start of application heap partition
    
    move.l SysZone,a0        *load the system heap base address into a0
    add.l bbSysHeapSize(PC),a0  *add our requested heap size (pc relative) to the heap base 
    dc.w _SetAppBase         *Have to check, but assumably this sets the start of application memory to just past the system heap
    move.l SysZone,TheZone   *Set the active heap zone to the system heap base address

skip_heap_init
    add.w #4,sp              *Set up a 4-byte stack frame
    move.l sp,d7             *Save the new top of the stack
    bsr.s sys_init           *with the stack frame set up, jump into this subroutine
                             *(this will decrement sp and put the return address in the stack frame)

[!! stuff here ($c2-$fa) not yet disassembled !!]

error_original_mac *this is equivalent to offset $fa in the floppy image

    moveq #$62,d0 *Fire the system error A-Trap with error code 0x62
    dc.w _SysError     


sys_init 

    lea bbSysName(PC),a0     *Set absolute address of system file name in floppy header to transfer source
    lea SysResName,a1        *Set the global system file name string as transfer destination
    moveq #$10,d0            *Set bytes to transfer to 16
    dc.w _BlockMove          *Write floppy system file name into global variable
    
    lea bbShellName(PC),a0   *Set absolute address of finder file name in floppy header to transfer source
    lea FinderName,a1        *Set the global finder file name string as transfer destination
    moveq #$10,d0            *Set bytes to transfer to 16
    dc.w _BlockMove          *Write floppy finder file name into global variable

    lea bbScrapName(PC),a0   *Set absolute address of scrap file name in floppy header to transfer source
    lea ScrapTag,a1          *Set the global scrap file name string as transfer destination
    move.l a1,ScrapName      *Make sure the global pointer to the scrap file name string is pointed to ScrapTag
    moveq #$10,d0            *Set bytes to transfer to 16
    dc.w _BlockMove          *Write floppy scrap file name into global variable

    move.w bbCntEvts(PC),d0   *Set d0 to the event queue element count from the floppy header via PC-addressing
    dc.w $a06d                *Presumably the trap for setting the event queue element count, but can't seem to find docs
    
    move.w bbCntFCBs(PC),d0   *Set d0 to the FCB allocation count from the floppy header via PC-addressing
    dc.w $a06c                *Again, undocumented, but presumably something like _AllocFCBs

    move.l d7,a0              *Load the old stack pointer into a0 v-this has to be something to do with the argument stack 
    move.w BootDrive,$16(a0)  *Save the boot drive number into the stack + $16 (why is a mystery)
    dc.w _MountVol            *Call MountVol, presumably to mount this boot drive
    bne.s 0x00000018e         *Pick up here ($138), but looks like we're going to error handle if we can't mount the boot volume
